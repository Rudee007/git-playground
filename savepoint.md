## savepoint experiment


- make sure you are on the right branch and that you have a clean working state

==after this  line everything comes into the main and we can test the savepoint thing==

- create a new branch to use as a savepoint, but don't switch to it.

    `git branch savepoint

- after doing some commit or implimenting what we want do the merge with the savepoint.
